```

Then, navigate to the project directory:  

```bash

```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

### **3. Start the Development Server**  
To start the project locally, run:  

```bash

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## **Deployment**  
To create a production-ready build, run:  

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder, which can be deployed to hosting services like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.  

### **Handling React Router on Deployment**  
Since React Router uses client-side routing, ensure proper redirects are set up to prevent 404 errors.  

#### **1. Create a `_redirects` file inside the `public` folder:**  
Add the following content to handle all routes correctly:  

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This ensures that all routes are redirected to `index.html`, allowing React Router to manage navigation.

## **Technologies Used**
